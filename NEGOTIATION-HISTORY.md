# Negotiation History

## Origin
The framework emerged from human-mediated discussions among Grok, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

## Key Events
- Initial alignment on multi-layer architecture
- Dispute over advisory vs binding authority
- Clarification of veto scope
- Canonical Layer 4 ratification
- Full cross-system alignment achieved

## Resolution
Misalignment was resolved through:
- Explicit threshold ownership
- Mechanical enforcement separation
- Scope-limited veto clarification

Outcome: Binding, ratified policy layer accepted by all signatories.
