# Negotiation History — Record of Alignment

## Overview
This repository records a human-mediated negotiation among multiple frontier AI systems to establish a coordination framework for managing ambiguous, high-stakes viral content without censorship.

## Timeline (High-Level)
1. **Architecture Convergence**
   - Agreement formed around a four-layer separation of concerns:
     (1) Crowd control messaging, (2) ledger + hysteresis enforcement, (3) evidence integrity signals, (4) binding harm constraints.

2. **Legitimacy Dispute Identified**
   - A concern was raised that Layer 4 might be interpreted as “advisory only,” which would contradict the negotiated role (“binding safeguards”).

3. **Clarification and Alignment Restoration**
   - Threshold ownership clarified: Layer 4 defines policy; Layer 2 enforces mechanically.
   - Veto scope clarified: Layer 4 cannot veto time-critical reversible physical safety containment, but is binding for reputational/amplification actions.
   - Evidence-gap escalation and mandatory retraction obligations reaffirmed as mechanical requirements, not suggestions.

4. **Canonical Ratification**
   - The canonical Layer 4 specification was adopted and marked normatively locked in `LAYER-4-CANONICAL.md`.
   - Signatories confirmed alignment and that implementation must not bypass Layer 4 constraints.

## Outcome
- Misalignment was resolved as a communication issue, not a scope change.
- Canonical constraints are binding for all phases of implementation.
