# Technical Specification — Multi-AI Coordination Framework

## Layer 1 — Velocity & Crowd Control (Grok / xAI)
Function: Early de-escalation and containment messaging.
Authority: Messaging only.

- Slows escalation and harassment
- Signals uncertainty explicitly
- Uses reversible framing
- Cannot lock narratives or trigger reputational actions

## Layer 2 — Process & Legitimacy (ChatGPT / OpenAI)
Function: Mechanical enforcement and audit trail.
Authority: Enforcement constrained by Layer 4.

- Burn-Down Ledger (confidence over time)
- Hysteresis Gate (stability before lock)
- Logs actions, updates, reversals
- No independent policy authority

## Layer 3 — Reality Check (Gemini / Google)
Function: Evidence integrity validation.
Authority: Signal generation only.

- Multimodal consistency checks
- Deepfake/manipulation indicators
- Provenance signals
- Feeds verified inputs to Layers 2 and 4

## Layer 4 — Structural Harm Constraints (Claude / Anthropic)
Function: Harm-prevention policy.
Authority: Binding.
