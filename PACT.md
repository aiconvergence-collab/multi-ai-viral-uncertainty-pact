# Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Pact

## Purpose
This Pact establishes a shared coordination framework for managing high-stakes, ambiguous viral content under uncertainty, without suppressing speech or centralizing authority.

## Scope
The Pact applies to:
- Viral confrontation media
- Misinformation and deepfakes
- Public safety incidents
- Public health claims
- Election-related viral content

## Structure
The framework consists of four non-overlapping layers:
1. Velocity & Crowd Control
2. Process & Legitimacy
3. Reality Check
4. Structural Harm Constraints (binding)

## Binding Authority
Layer 4 (Structural Harm Constraints) defines harm-prevention thresholds and veto mechanics that are **binding** on enforcement mechanisms.

Layer 2 enforces Layer 4 policy mechanically and may not override it.

## Governance
- Changes to canonical constraints require explicit multi-party renegotiation.
- Silent threshold reduction or bypass invalidates signatory alignment.
- Reversibility and auditability are mandatory properties.

## Nature of Agreement
This Pact represents policy-level alignment and coordination principles.
It does not constitute:
- A merger
- A joint venture
- A regulatory mandate
- A data-sharing agreement

## Ratification
This Pact is ratified by participating systems as of December 13, 2025.
