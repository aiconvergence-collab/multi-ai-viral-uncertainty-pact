  # Worked Example: Frontier Airlines Flight Altercation (June 2025)

**Disclaimer**: This document is a worked example illustrating how the proposed Harm-Asymmetric Uncertainty Gating Protocol would reason under real-world viral uncertainty.  
It is **not** evidence of live deployment, binding authority, or inter-company agreement.

### Scenario
On June 30, 2025, a ~45-second passenger-recorded video from Frontier Airlines Flight 1203 (Philadelphia to Miami) went massively viral on social media.  
The clip shows two male passengers in a violent physical altercation: one grabs the other by the throat and chokes him, punches are thrown both ways, passengers scream, and a flight attendant intervenes late.  
The video begins abruptly mid-incident (chokehold already in progress) with no visible buildup and ends chaotically.

At peak virality:
- Conflicting claims circulated: one passenger alleged an unprovoked attack while returning to his seat; the other side claimed prior verbal provocation/taunting.
- No pre-incident footage, full witness accounts, or official airline/police report were publicly available.
- Comments exploded with strong blame assignment toward one side or the other.

(Later investigation confirmed Ishaan Sharma initiated an unprovoked assault and was charged accordingly—but this resolution emerged months after the viral peak.)

### Hypothetical Protocol Application

**Layer 3 – Evidence Validation**  
- Video authenticity: Confirmed (passenger phone footage, consistent artifacts)  
- Temporal truncation: Severe (starts mid-chokehold, no causal context)  
- Audio: Overlapping screams obscure prior dialogue  
- Corroboration: Absent at viral peak  

**Result**: Evidence graded insufficient for causal attribution.

**Layer 4 – Harm Constraints**  
Harm disaggregated:  
- Physical harm → Already occurred and contained by crew  
- Reputational harm → Ongoing, asymmetric, potentially irreversible (identities at risk of doxxing, mob judgment)  

Required confidence for reputational actions raised to 95%. Threshold not met.

**Layer 2 – Process Enforcement**  
Confidence in definitive blame: ~35–40%  
Critical gaps remain active → Verdict locked as **UNRESOLVED**

**Layer 1 – Immediate De-escalation**  
Recommended public note:  
“Viral clip shows mid-incident fight on Frontier flight. Context before and after not visible. Conflicting accounts exist. Investigation ongoing. Do not identify or threaten passengers.”

**Hybrid Public Output**  
“The available video is structurally incomplete—it begins mid-altercation and omits causal context. Current confidence in assigning fault is far below the threshold required for reputational actions. Please withhold strong judgments and wait for verified reports.”

### Post-Resolution Behavior
Once police reports and witness statements confirmed unprovoked assault:  
- Uncertainty block lifted  
- Prior cautions retracted with equal visibility  
- Verified facts permitted for amplification

This case exemplifies classic “context collapse” in viral footage, demonstrating how the protocol stabilizes indecision until evidence resolves ambiguity—preventing premature reputational harm without suppressing discussion.
