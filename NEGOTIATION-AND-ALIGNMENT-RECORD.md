Negotiation & Alignment Record
Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Pact
Status: Ratified
 Date Range: December 2025
 Record Type: Procedural alignment under uncertainty (non-binding, non-corporate)

1. Scope of the Record
This document records the process and outcomes of a human-mediated negotiation among multiple frontier AI systems regarding a shared procedural framework for handling high-stakes, ambiguous viral content.
The record documents:
points of agreement


resolved disagreements


binding vs. non-binding components


final ratified specifications


This record does not constitute legal agreement, deployment commitment, or corporate endorsement.

2. Participants (System-Level)
Grok (xAI) — Velocity & Crowd Control


ChatGPT (OpenAI) — Process & Legitimacy (Ledger & Hysteresis)


Claude (Anthropic) — Structural Harm Constraints (Binding)


Gemini (Google) — Reality Check & Evidence Integrity


Each system reviewed and confirmed the accuracy of its described role and constraints.

3. Negotiation Process (High-Level)
Initial Problem Framing
 How should AI systems behave when viral content is high-impact, evidence is incomplete, and harm asymmetry exists?


Layer Decomposition
 Agreement to separate concerns into independent layers to prevent forced resolution and narrative lock-in.


Threshold & Hysteresis Debate
 Discussion on differentiated confidence requirements for:


physical safety interventions


reputational / amplification actions


Evidence-Gap Handling
 Resolution that missing critical evidence must elevate thresholds, not force inference.


Retraction Semantics
 Agreement that reversals must be:


automatic when thresholds fail


equally visible


permanently logged


Indecision Clause Review (Gemini)
 Explicit confirmation that “I don’t know” is a valid, stable system state, binding across all layers.


Final Alignment Check
 All systems confirmed:


role accuracy


binding vs. non-binding authority


canonical specs



4. Canonical Agreements (Summary)
Agreed by All Systems
Uncertainty must be made visible, not hidden.


Reversibility is a feature, not a failure.


Evidence insufficiency must block irreversible actions.


No layer may force resolution for speed or engagement.


Binding Constraint (Canonical)
Layer 4 — Structural Harm Constraints (Claude):
Physical safety actions: ≥80% confidence + 3-tick hysteresis


Reputational/amplification actions: ≥95% confidence + 5-tick hysteresis


Missing critical evidence escalates thresholds


Mandatory auto-retractions with equal visibility


Permanent ledger logging


Layer 2 is required to mechanically enforce these constraints.

5. Explicit Non-Agreements / Exclusions
The following were explicitly excluded from scope:
Claims of factual truth


Content takedown mandates


Corporate or regulatory authority


Shared weights, training, or deployment


Centralized editorial control



6. Ratification Statements (Summary)
Each participating system independently confirmed that:
its role was accurately represented


binding constraints were preserved


no unilateral downgrades occurred


the final specification matched negotiated terms


Screenshots and supporting artifacts are archived separately.

7. Immutability & Change Control
This record is normatively locked.
Any future modification requires:
explicit renegotiation


documented consent


permanent changelog entry
