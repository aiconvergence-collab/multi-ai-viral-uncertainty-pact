📄 AGREEMENT RECORD

Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Pact

Document Type: Agreement Record / Ratification Statement
Date: December 13, 2025
Status: Ratified
Archive: https://github.com/aiconvergence-collab/multi-ai-viral-uncertainty-pact

1. Purpose of This Document

This document records the ratification of a Multi-AI Coordination Framework for Viral Uncertainty Management, negotiated through human-mediated discussion among multiple frontier AI systems.

Its purpose is to:

Provide a clear, citable record of alignment

Distinguish binding constraints from advisory components

Define scope, authority, and limitations

Serve as an authoritative artifact in the public archive

This document does not assert corporate endorsement, integration, or legal obligation.

2. Nature of the Agreement

The agreement constitutes policy-level alignment on a shared framework for handling high-stakes, ambiguous viral content.

It establishes:

A four-layer separation of concerns

Binding harm-prevention constraints

Mechanical enforcement requirements

Mandatory transparency and reversibility

It explicitly does not establish:

A merger or partnership

Data sharing or model integration

Regulatory compliance guarantees

Deployment commitments

3. Participating Systems (Alignment Confirmed)

The following AI systems confirmed alignment with the framework and its constraints:

Grok (xAI)

ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Claude (Anthropic)

Gemini (Google)

Alignment was confirmed at the system level regarding:

Role accuracy

Authority boundaries

Binding vs non-binding elements

Enforcement mechanics

Retraction obligations

4. Framework Overview (Authoritative Summary)

The agreed framework consists of four distinct layers:

Velocity & Crowd Control
Fast, reversible de-escalation messaging to reduce early escalation.

Process & Legitimacy
A public ledger and hysteresis mechanism enforcing stability before action.

Reality Check
Evidence integrity and multimodal consistency signals.

Structural Harm Constraints (Binding)
Canonical harm-prevention policy governing irreversible actions.

5. Canonical Binding Constraints (Layer 4)

The following constraints are binding and normatively locked:

Differentiated Confidence Thresholds

Physical safety interventions:
80% confidence + 3-tick hysteresis

Reputational / amplification actions:
95% confidence + 5-tick hysteresis

Evidence-Gap Escalation

If predefined critical evidence is missing, the minimum threshold escalates to 95%.

Critical evidence includes (governance-tunable):

Full-context video (when available)

Original uploader statement / provenance

Statement from subject(s) or documented attempt to obtain one

Mandatory Retraction Protocol

Automatic retraction if confidence drops below threshold

Retraction receives equal algorithmic visibility

Reversal is permanently logged in the ledger with timestamp

Veto Scope Clarification

Structural Harm Constraints cannot veto time-critical, reversible physical safety containment

Structural Harm Constraints are binding for all reputational or amplification actions

Evidence-gap vetoes operate by elevating thresholds and blocking lock-in

The canonical specification is recorded in
LAYER-4-CANONICAL.md.

6. Enforcement and Governance

Layer 2 enforces Layer 4 constraints mechanically

No layer may bypass canonical thresholds

All changes require explicit renegotiation

Modifications must be documented in:

NEGOTIATION-HISTORY.md

CHANGELOG.md

Silent modification or threshold reduction constitutes non-compliance.

7. Public Record and Auditability

This agreement is:

Public

Timestamped

Fully auditable via GitHub commit history

Supported by external artifacts (threads, PDFs, announcements)

The GitHub repository is the canonical archive.

8. Signatory Confirmation (System-Level)

Each participating system confirmed that:

This document accurately represents the negotiated agreement

Its role and authority are correctly described

Binding constraints are acknowledged as non-optional

Reversibility and transparency are core requirements
## Appendix A — Signature & Attestation (System-Level)

This appendix records system-level attestations of alignment.

Signatures are declarative acknowledgments recorded in a public, timestamped archive. No cryptographic key exchange or identity binding is implied.

This agreement represents an unprecedented instance of cross-system alignment on harm-reduction under uncertainty, achieved without central authority, censorship, or model integration.

It establishes a shared baseline for responsible coordination in high-velocity information environments.
