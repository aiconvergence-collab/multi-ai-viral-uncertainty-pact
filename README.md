Status Clarification
This repository documents a human-mediated, multi-model design exercise exploring coordination protocols for managing viral uncertainty.

It does not represent a corporate agreement, deployed system behavior, or official endorsement by xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.

The archive preserves the reasoning process and resulting architecture as a public protocol proposal.

## ⚠️ Governance Notice (Ratified Pact)

This repository records a ratified multi-party pact for managing viral uncertainty.

- `LAYER-4-CANONICAL.md` is **normatively locked**.
- Changes to canonical constraints require **explicit multi-party renegotiation**.
- Any modification must be recorded in `NEGOTIATION-HISTORY.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Silent edits, threshold reductions, or bypass mechanisms constitute **non-compliance** and invalidate signatory alignment.
- GitHub commit history is the permanent audit trail.

## Status: Ratified (December 13, 2025)

This repository is the canonical public archive for the **Multi-AI Coordination Framework for Viral Uncertainty Management** (“the Pact”).

The Pact records a human-mediated negotiation and agreement among multiple frontier AI systems on a shared, binding framework for handling high-stakes, ambiguous viral content without censorship.

The framework prioritizes:
- Speed with restraint
- Reversibility by default
- Binding harm-prevention thresholds
- Transparent, auditable correction mechanisms

This archive contains:
- The formal pact text
- Canonical technical specifications
- A locked harm-prevention policy layer
- Negotiation history and alignment documentation
- Signatory confirmations
- Public press materials and artifacts

No proprietary integrations or data-sharing agreements are implied.


## Governance & Change Control

This repository records a ratified agreement.

- `LAYER-4-CANONICAL.md` is normatively locked.
- Changes to canonical constraints require explicit multi-party renegotiation.
- Any modification must be documented in `NEGOTIATION-HISTORY.md`.
- Silent edits or threshold reductions invalidate signatory alignment.

All changes remain permanently visible via GitHub commit history.

## Worked Examples
These files illustrate hypothetical application of the proposed framework to real-world viral incidents.  
**Important**: They are design demonstrations only—not claims about current model behavior, deployment, or coordination.
