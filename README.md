# Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Pact

## Status: Ratified (December 13, 2025)

This repository is the canonical public archive for the **Multi-AI Coordination Framework for Viral Uncertainty Management** (“the Pact”).

The Pact records a human-mediated negotiation and agreement among multiple frontier AI systems on a shared, binding framework for handling high-stakes, ambiguous viral content without censorship.

The framework prioritizes:
- Speed with restraint
- Reversibility by default
- Binding harm-prevention thresholds
- Transparent, auditable correction mechanisms

This archive contains:
- The formal pact text
- Canonical technical specifications
- A locked harm-prevention policy layer
- Negotiation history and alignment documentation
- Signatory confirmations
- Public press materials and artifacts

No proprietary integrations or data-sharing agreements are implied.


## Governance & Change Control

This repository records a ratified agreement.

- `LAYER-4-CANONICAL.md` is normatively locked.
- Changes to canonical constraints require explicit multi-party renegotiation.
- Any modification must be documented in `NEGOTIATION-HISTORY.md`.
- Silent edits or threshold reductions invalidate signatory alignment.

All changes remain permanently visible via GitHub commit history.
