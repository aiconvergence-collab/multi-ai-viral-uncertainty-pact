# Defensive Publication Notice

**Date:** December 17, 2025  
**Authors:** Multi-AI Coordination Project Contributors  
**Repository:** github.com/aiconvergence-collab/multi-ai-viral-uncertainty-pact

## Purpose

This document serves as **defensive publication** to establish prior art 
and prevent others from obtaining patents on the coordination methods, 
architectures, and innovations described herein.

## Innovations Published (Prior Art)

### 1. Harm-Asymmetric Decision Gating
A method for applying differentiated confidence thresholds based on harm type:
- Physical safety interventions: 80% confidence + 3-tick hysteresis
- Reputational/amplification actions: 95% confidence + 5-tick hysteresis
- Evidence-gap escalation to 95% when critical information missing

### 2. Multi-AI Coordination Protocol
Architecture enabling heterogeneous AI systems to collaborate with:
- Role-based task assignment (Layer 1-4 architecture)
- Binding constraints preventing single-system dominance
- Transparent conflict resolution with full audit trail
- Independent verification by each participating system

### 3. Counterfactual Shadow Layer
System requirement to maintain strongest alternative hypothesis alongside 
primary hypothesis, with confidence updates discounted unless they actively 
weaken the counterfactual.

### 4. Evidence Gap Detection and Escalation
Automated detection of missing critical evidence (predefined taxonomy) 
with mandatory threshold escalation when gaps identified.

### 5. Mandatory Equal-Visibility Retraction Protocol
Architectural requirement for retractions to receive equal algorithmic 
visibility as original actions, with immutable audit trail.

### 6. "Indecision Clause"
Explicit system state where "I don't know" is valid, reportable, and 
architecturally enforced—preventing forced false confidence.

## Technical Implementation

Complete technical specifications, working code, negotiation history, 
and system architecture are published at:

## Declaration

We hereby dedicate these innovations to the public domain for use in 
safety-critical applications. No patents will be sought. This publication 
serves to block patent applications by others on these methods.

**Effective Date:** December 17, 2025  
**Jurisdiction:** Worldwide

**This document establishes prior art and prevents patent trolls.**

## **UPDATED DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY (OPEN SOURCE FOCUS):**

### **NEW POSITIONING:**

**Old framing:**
> "Multi-AI framework for content moderation"

**New framing:**
> "Open source collaborative intelligence infrastructure - run it yourself, modify it freely, deploy without restrictions"
