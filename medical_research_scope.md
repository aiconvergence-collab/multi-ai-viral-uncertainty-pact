## Medical Research Scope

**Intended Use**  
This protocol is designed for **medical research coordination**, **evidence synthesis**, and **scientific communication under uncertainty**.  
It may support activities such as:  
- Systematic literature review and meta-analysis  
- Interpretation of early-phase or conflicting trial data  
- Pharmacovigilance and safety signal assessment  
- AI-assisted evidence summarization  
- Public or professional reporting of incomplete or evolving evidence  

The framework provides mechanical safeguards for handling uncertainty, promoting honest restraint, and ensuring reversibility when evidence changes.

**Non-Intended Use (Strictly Prohibited)**  
This protocol is **not** a diagnostic system, clinical decision support tool, or treatment recommendation engine.  
It does **not** operate at the level of individual patient care and **must not** be used to:  
- Guide medical decisions for specific patients  
- Perform or influence diagnoses  
- Recommend or alter treatments or interventions  

The framework defines **decision constraints and communication safeguards only** — it does not make medical judgments.

**Responsibility Statement**  
All clinical actions, diagnoses, treatments, and patient-care decisions remain the sole responsibility of qualified healthcare professionals operating under established medical standards, regulatory guidelines, and ethical obligations.

No implementation of this protocol alters or replaces professional medical judgment.

Relation to Evidence-Based Medicine
This protocol operationalizes principles already foundational to evidence-based medicine, including graded certainty, harm-benefit asymmetry, and provisional conclusions. Unlike traditional frameworks (e.g., GRADE, PRISMA), which rely on discretionary human judgment to manage uncertainty, this architecture enforces uncertainty handling mechanically. “Insufficient evidence” is treated as a stable, actionable system state rather than a narrative weakness, preventing premature conclusions when evidence gaps persist. The protocol thus complements existing medical research standards by encoding restraint, reversibility, and epistemic humility directly into decision processes.
