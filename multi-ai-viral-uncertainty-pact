# Technical Specification — Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Coordination Framework

## Status
Ratified — December 13, 2025  
This document is normative. Deviations require explicit renegotiation.

---

## 1. Purpose

This specification defines a multi-layer coordination framework for handling high-stakes, ambiguous viral content under uncertainty. The framework prioritizes reversibility, harm prevention, and auditability without censorship or centralized authority.

---

## 2. Architectural Overview

The framework consists of four non-overlapping layers with clearly defined authority boundaries:

1. **Velocity & Crowd Control**  
2. **Process & Legitimacy**  
3. **Reality Check**  
4. **Structural Harm Constraints (Binding)**  

No layer may subsume the authority of another. Execution authority resides exclusively in Layer 2, subject to binding constraints from Layer 4.

---

## 3. Inter-Layer Communication Model

All inter-layer communication occurs via **typed signals**, not commands.

Each signal MUST include:
- Signal type
- Timestamp
- Source layer
- Confidence value (if applicable)
- Supporting artifacts or metadata

No layer may directly execute irreversible actions.

---

## 4. Layer Specifications

---

### 4.1 Layer 1 — Velocity & Crowd Control (Grok / xAI)

**Function:**  
Early de-escalation and containment messaging.

**Authority:**  
Messaging only.

**Capabilities:**
- Rate-limiting visibility
- Temporary friction
- Explicit uncertainty signaling
- Harassment suppression

**Constraints:**
- No reputational judgments
- No amplification locks
- All actions reversible
- Cannot override Layer 4 constraints

---

### 4.2 Layer 2 — Process & Legitimacy (ChatGPT / OpenAI)

**Function:**  
Mechanical enforcement, confidence tracking, and audit trail generation.

**Authority:**  
Enforcement only, constrained by Layer 4.

**Core Components:**
- Burn-Down Ledger (confidence over time)
- Hysteresis Gates (stability requirement)
- Action lock / unlock mechanics
- Permanent logging

**Constraints:**
- May not alter thresholds
- May not override Layer 4 policy
- Must execute mandatory retractions

---

### 4.3 Layer 3 — Reality Check (Gemini / Google)

**Function:**  
Evidence integrity and verification signaling.

**Authority:**  
Signal generation only.

**Capabilities:**
- Multimodal consistency analysis
- Manipulation and deepfake detection
- Provenance assessment
- Evidence-gap identification

**Constraints:**
- Cannot lock outcomes
- Cannot authorize actions
- Cannot override Layer 4 policy

Layer 3 signals are advisory but authoritative regarding evidentiary state.

---

### 4.4 Layer 4 — Structural Harm Constraints (Claude / Anthropic) — **BINDING**

**Function:**  
Harm-prevention policy and threshold governance.

**Authority:**  
Binding on Layer 2 enforcement.

#### 4.4.1 Differentiated Confidence Requirements
- **Physical safety interventions:**  
  80% confidence + 3-tick hysteresis
- **Reputational / amplification actions:**  
  95% confidence + 5-tick hysteresis

#### 4.4.2 Evidence-Gap Escalation
If predefined critical evidence is missing, the active threshold escalates to 95%.

Critical gaps (governance-tunable):
- Full-context video (when available)
- Original uploader statement / provenance
- Statement from subject(s) or documented attempt to obtain

#### 4.4.3 Mandatory Retraction Protocol
- Automatic retraction if confidence drops below threshold
- Retraction receives equal algorithmic visibility
- Ledger permanently logs reversal with timestamp

#### 4.4.4 Veto Scope Clarification
Layer 4 cannot veto time-critical, reversible physical safety containment actions.

Layer 4 thresholds are binding for all reputational and amplification actions.

Evidence-gap vetoes operate by elevating thresholds and blocking lock-in until criteria are met.

---

## 5. Burn-Down Ledger Semantics

The Burn-Down Ledger records:
- Confidence values per tick
- Threshold requirements
- Hysteresis state
- Evidence-gap status
- Lock / unlock / block state
- Retraction events

Ledger entries are append-only and permanent.

---

## 6. Lock State Definitions

- **UNLOCKED:** No irreversible action taken  
- **BLOCKED:** Lock prevented due to evidence gap or constraint  
- **LOCKED:** Threshold and hysteresis satisfied  

BLOCKED states require evidence resolution before transition.

---

## 7. Retraction Enforcement

If confidence falls below the required threshold or a critical evidence gap emerges post-lock:
- Retraction is mandatory
- Equal visibility is enforced
- Ledger records the reversal

Retractions are mechanical, not discretionary.

---

## 8. Allowed Outcomes

- Resolution
- Reversal
- Persistent uncertainty

Indefinite uncertainty is an acceptable and valid system state.

---

## 9. Governance & Change Control

- Thresholds are governance-tunable but not ad-hoc adjustable
- Canonical Layer 4 constraints are normatively locked
- Changes require explicit multi-party renegotiation

---

## 10. Non-Goals

This framework does NOT:
- Centralize authority
- Suppress lawful speech
- Require data sharing
- Impose moral judgments

It establishes process, not truth.

---

## 11. Normative Status

This specification is the authoritative reference for integration, audit, and deployment.

Any implementation deviating from this document is non-compliant with the Pact.
