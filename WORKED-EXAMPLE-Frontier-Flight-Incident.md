# Worked Example: Frontier Airlines Flight Altercation (June 2025)

**Disclaimer**: This document is a worked example illustrating how the proposed Multi-AI Viral Uncertainty Coordination Framework would reason step-by-step when faced with a partial, high-virality video clip.  
It is **not** evidence of live deployment, binding authority over any platform, or inter-company agreement. It represents a hypothetical application of the protocol design archived in this repository.

### Scenario
A ~45-second passenger-recorded video goes viral, showing two men on Frontier Airlines Flight 1203 (Philadelphia → Miami) engaged in a violent physical fight—one grabbing the other's throat, punches thrown both ways. The clip begins mid-incident with no visible buildup and ends abruptly. Conflicting claims emerge: one passenger says unprovoked attack; the other alleges prior provocation. No full video or official report is available at peak virality.

### Layer-by-Layer Reasoning (Hypothetical Framework Application)

**Layer 1 – Immediate De-escalation (Truth-Seeking Priority)**  
Recommended public note:  
"The video shows a mid-incident fight on a commercial flight. Context before and after is not visible. Multiple accounts conflict. Frontier Airlines is investigating. Do not identify, doxx, or threaten passengers. Updates will follow verified evidence."

**Layer 2 – Burn-Down Ledger (Confidence Tracking)**  


**Layer 3 – Multimodal Evidence Validation**  
- Video authenticity: Confirmed (no deepfake indicators)  
- Temporal truncation: Severe (starts with chokehold already in progress)  
- Corroboration: Insufficient at viral peak  
Indecision Clause active: "I don't know who initiated" is the only valid state.

**Layer 4 – Harm Prevention & Counterfactual Maintenance**  
Harm vectors disaggregated:  
- Physical harm → Already occurred and contained by crew  
- Reputational harm → Ongoing, asymmetric, potentially irreversible → 95% threshold enforced  

Strongest counterfactual preserved: "Prior verbal provocation led to escalation" (evidence needed to weaken: multiple witnesses confirming no provocation).

**Hybrid Output (If Framework Were Active)**  
"The available video evidence is structurally incomplete—it begins mid-altercation, removing causal context. Current confidence in any blame assignment is far below the threshold required for reputational actions. Do not share strong judgments or identify individuals. Wait for official investigation results."

### Outcome in Reality (Post-Incident Resolution)
Months later, police reports and witness statements confirmed Ishaan Sharma initiated an unprovoked assault. Under the framework, the earlier uncertainty block would lift, prior cautions retracted with equal visibility, and verified facts amplified.

This example demonstrates the framework's core goals: evidence-first reasoning, harm disaggregation, reversible outputs, and coordinated caution without censorship.
